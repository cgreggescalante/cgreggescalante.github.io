# cgreggescalante.github.io

This project is the source for my GitHub Pages site. The site was developed using [Angular](https://angular.io/), then [Scully.io](https://scully.io/) was used to convert it into a static website that could be hosted on through GitHub Pages.

Also note that this is very much a work in progress and there are only a few projects with some information available.
