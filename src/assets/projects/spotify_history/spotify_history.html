  Around the start of January this year, I became aware of a tool Spotify had hidden away on their website that allowed you to download a file containing your listening history for the past year or so.
  As someone who loves being able to dive into data, this made me really excited about what could be done with those records.
  I filled out the form to request my data, and a few days later I received an email with a link to download my listening history.
</p>

<p>
  Upon downloading the data, I found that it included much more information than I originally expected.
  Among the files was one containing everything that I had saved to my library, another containing information about all the searches I had made in the past 3 months.
  One that really piqued my interest was a file titled 'Inferences'.
  With some inspection, I realized it contained various markers the Spotify believed were accurate descriptions of me.
  It included simple things, such as what phone I used, what sorts of music I liked to listen to, and the makes of some cars I had connected to with my phone while listening to music.
  Some other inferences were much more interesting.
  Spotify had determined that I was a college student, that I was a runner, and that I was outdoorsy.
  I'd love to figure out more about how they were able to determine this from my listening history, or what other information they had access to when making those judgements.
</p>

<p>
  I turned my attention towards three files labeled 'StreamingHistory'.
  They contained records of every time I had listened to any track or podcast using Spotify.
  Each entry (of which there were almost 56k) contained the time and date that I finished listening to the song, the name of the artist and the track, and the number of milliseconds I listened for.
  I had really hoped that the entries would include the URI which spotify associates with every form of media on the platform (this did cause some difficulties later down the line).
</p>

<p>
  While I do like JSON data quite a lot, the volume of the data meant that it would be much easier to load it into a database.
  I chose SQLite, because that's the database I'm most familiar with. I created a table titled 'play' to hold each play in my listening history.
  I added all the data from each entry in my history to this database, except the 'endTime' field, which I split into separate date and time columns.
  While this data alone would enable some interesting insights into my listening, I knew that I could do much more if I was able to utilise Spotify's track features which are generated for each track.
  These features include values quantifying energy, acousticness, liveness, and even a measure of how danceable a track is.
</p>

<p>
  Here's where the issue with not having the URIs comes in.
  In order to obtain the track features, I need to make a call to the Spotify API in which I provide the URI for the track I want features for.
  After a little investigation, I figured that the easiest way to gather all the URIs for tracks I listened to was to call the 'search' API endpoint with a query string of the track's title followed by the artist's name.
  While I could make those calls myself with Python's Request library, OAuth has always eluded my understanding, and the Spotify API documentation lists bindings for many languages.
  Of the offerings for Python, I chose Spotipy, as it seemed to be the most complete implementation available.
</p>

<p>
  Taking each unique track name and artist pair from play table, I performed used the search endpoint with a query term consisting of the track and the artist.
  Fortunately, this ended up being 100% reliable in returning the correct tracks.
  In the data returned from this operation was the URI, which I added to the corresponding entries in the play table.
  Then, I used the URIs I had gathered in the track features endpoint to then save the track name, artist, album, uri, duration, and all 12 of Spotify's generated values to a new 'track' table.
  This data also included the URIs for the artists for each track, which I used to create a table of artists, including their follower count on Spotify, and an integer representing their popularity.
</p>

<p>
  Now that I finally had all the data I wanted, it was time to begin some simple analysis.
  I started by determining my top artists, albums, and tracks for the past year.

  <figcaption>Checks out, the only one that I wasn't expecting to see was "A Horse with No Name", but that's a song I like playing on guitar a lot, so that would explain it's position.</figcaption>

<p>
  Now this is all fine and dandy, but I didn't get all this neat information just to find out what music I like, I already have a decent idea of that.
  Maybe I'll start with some aggregates of my listening.
</p>

<p>
  This is a little more interesting.
  So it looks like I listened to almost 70,000 minutes of music through October, that works out to about 1,160 hours, or 48.3 days of music.
  That definitely sounds like a lot of music, especially given that this dataset only covers the first 304 days of the year.
  Assuming that I average 8 hours of sleep each night, that means I spend 23.8% of my waking hours listening to music.
  In the month of January, when I spent 171.2 hours listening, that figure was nearly 35%.
  Dang.
</p>

<p>
  What else can I do with this data? Maybe I could break this down further into each week.
</p>

<p>
  I thought this would be more difficult to make, but SQLite has a nice function for translating dates into weeks.
  You've probably noticed that week 32 seems to be missing, but that is real data.
  I listened to absolutely no music that week, because I was on a camping trip with some friends, during which my phone was rarely charged.
  While I was making this, I started wondering about how my listening correlates with days of the week.
  I'll do that next.

  Huh.
  This mostly makes sense, as I do pretty much the same things every day, that being run, code, and eat.
  There isn't any specific explanation that pops to mind for the significant decrease on Saturdays.
  Most of this data would have been gathered while I was in college and participating in the sports teams there.
  Potentially, Saturday could be partially explained by the awkward timing of our practices those days.
  They were often later in the morning, around 10 usually.
  I typically would wake up much later those days, so I didn't have to find some way to occupy myself until practice.
  Saturdays were also frequently meet days, so I wouldn't be listening to music for most of the day.

Popular songs by day, how long were they popular for?
