  This project is at the intersection of two of my interests, those being generative art and simulating particle motion.
  In vector calculus and physics, a vector field is an assignment of a vector to each point in a subset of space.
  They can be used to represent the motion of fluids, or magnetic and gravitational forces, for example.
  For my application of a vector field, I used a finite array of PVector objects, as provided through the Processing library.
  For convenience, the dimensions of the array were set to match the pixel size of my screen.
  The PVectors were initialized with a constant magnitude, and a heading generated randomly.
  The headings were set using Processing's noise() function, which is an implementation of perlin noise.

  This is probably the simplest implementation of these ideas.
  At the beginning of the simulation, particles are instantiated in a regular grid arrangement with zero momentum, and a low mass.
  Despite the simplicity, it creates a complex network that can be best described with the same terminology typically used for river networks or blood vessels.
  The low mass and even arrangement of the particles causes them to quickly collect and form many 'streams'.
  These streams rapidly form a few distinct paths that meander across the field before reaching one of the edges.
  An interesting expansion on this setup would be to use the converging paths to map the simulated 'watersheds' that are formed.
  Such a diagram could be used to generate a complex network of valleys and ridges similar to the Driftless region of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois.

  To create this setup, I initialized all of the particles at the top of the canvas, all with significant downward momentum.
  In some iterations of this setup, I added a clause that removed all particles which began to travel upward.
  While this did make the results more consistent with the Curtain name, I chose to leave the chaotic motion, as I believe it creates a more interesting work.

  For this setup, the particles are distributed randomly within a set distance of the center.
