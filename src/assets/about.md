# About Me

I don't know what I should write here. Does this go on the same line? Yes it does.

This doesn't, though.

I should probably include a list of skills and interests. Something looking kinda like this:

## Languages
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Technologies
- Chai.js
- Spring Boot
- Angular, I guess?

## Interests
- Data! I like the number
- Bioinformatics is really cool, I don't think I know enough about biology, though
- Computational Mathematics, probably the same but with math
- Open Source stuff is very cool.
- Hating the government
- Seeking to overthrow the society we are trapped in.
- Analyzing my Spotify Data

## Databases
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- SQLite
- PostgreSQL
